## What Do You Need to Get Started?
Before running the demo, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [**Kind**](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation): A tool for creating local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers. Simply put, it helps you spin up a mini-cluster on your computer.

- [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): The command-line tool for managing Kubernetes. You canâ€™t do much without itâ€”itâ€™s essential.

- [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/): A package manager for Kubernetes. It helps you quickly install the applications you need into your cluster.

- [**Opentofu**](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli): A tool for managing infrastructure as code. With it, you can describe everything you need in config files, and the system will set it up for you.

## Running the Demo

### Step 1: Navigate to the Demo Directory

Open your terminal and go to the `demo/` folder where the `demo.sh` script is located.

```bash
cd demo/
```

### Step 2: Run the Script

Now, simply execute the `demo.sh` script. It will do all the magic for you:

```bash
./demo.sh
```

What does it do? Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- Creates a Kubernetes cluster using Kind.
- Deploys necessary services (e.g., Keycloak for authentication).
- Configures the environment so everything works as expected.

## What to Do After Running the Demo?

Once the script finishes, follow these simple steps to get everything up and running.

### Step 1: Add the Certificate to Trusted Certificates (MacOS)

To prevent your browser from complaining about self-signed certificates, add our certificate to the trusted store. Just run this command:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain .ssl/root-ca.pem
```

### Step 2: Log in as `learnops-admin`

Now, log in to the system using the admin account. Use the following command:

```bash
learnops login
```

And use these credentials:
- Username: `learnops-admin`
- Password: `learnops-admin`

### Step 3: Upload Courses

Next, upload the courses to the platform. Use the `learnops upload` command:

```bash
learnops upload -c courses/linux-basic/course.yml
learnops upload -c courses/git/course.yml
```

### Step 4: Open the Platform

Open your browser in incognito mode (or simply log out of the `learnops-admin` account if youâ€™re already logged in) and go to:

```
https://learnops.local
```

### Step 5: Log in as a Regular User

Now, log in as a regular user:
- Username: `user`
- Password: `user`

### Step 6: Assign Courses to the User

Finally, assign the uploaded courses to the user. Do this with the following command:

```bash
learnops assign -u user -c linux-basic -c git-basic
```

## All Set!

Now you can explore the platform, check out the courses, and enjoy the results. If something doesnâ€™t work as expected, donâ€™t worryâ€”just reach out to us, and weâ€™ll help you figure it out. Good luck! ðŸš€
